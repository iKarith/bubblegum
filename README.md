# Why tigrana

Okay, so [xoria256]() looks great, but it's missing a few things and it appears
to be stuck at v1.5 if I want to use it in a Pluggable format.  The author has
an open pull request from a non-public repository for v1.6.  I could go with
the non-pluggable version, but why?

Whilst looking for that, I found [bubblegum]().  Since there are a few things I
think I'd like to improve with xoria, I thought I'd have a look.

I'd say bubblegum is better organized and easier to maintain, but it needs
"more work" for me than xoria did.  It has less contrast and at times with
xoria I wanted more.  Since bubblegum gets more updates though and is easier to
maintain, I figured I'd go with that and de-bubblegum it back to xoria settings
where needed and then tweak the things I want.


## So why the name?

Xoria is a genus of moth.  Tigrana is another genus in the same family.  I'm
clever like that.  Or at least, Wikipedia is and I know how to use it.  :)


## Will you be updating both dark and light?

Probably, but just dark initially.  I am not a light person, although I
certainly could.  One of the advantages of using a 256 color terminal is that
you can easily see the color cube you have to work with and invert the
brightness scale.  For those using the GUIs with direct RGB values, these are
known.  :)


## Are you interested in sharing?

I didn't exactly ask @baskerville for permission to mod his colorscheme, and I
really didn't ask Dmitriy Zotikov.  Bastien, if you care to pull any of my
changes upstream at some point, feel free.  And if anyone else finds this theme
useful, feel free to derive from it.


## Where's that colors pic?

The one from the bubblegum `README.md`?  Right here:

And here's one I made using my little Python script:
